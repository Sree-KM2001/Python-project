# Python-project
Project Overview
I analyzed a dataset of 458 employees with 9 features, focusing on data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visual storytelling.

Tasks Accomplished
Preprocessing:

Replaced inconsistent height values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data integrity.
Analysis:

Distribution of employees across teams and percentage split.
Employee segregation by position.
Predominant age group identification.
Analysis of team/position with the highest salary expenditure.
Correlation between age and salary, supported by a visualization.
Visualizations:

Created graphs for each analysis task to effectively communicate insights.
Data Story:

Highlighted trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset.
Submission Highlights
A well-documented Jupyter Notebook.
Detailed insights in the README file on GitHub.
Dataset and code shared via GitHub.
This project was a great opportunity to apply Python skills to real-world data analysis and visualization. ðŸ’»ðŸ“ˆ
